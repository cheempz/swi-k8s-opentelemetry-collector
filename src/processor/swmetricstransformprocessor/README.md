# SW Metrics Transform Processor

This processor is a customized copy of Metrics Transform Processor available from https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/metricstransformprocessor

Supported pipeline types: metrics

## Description

The metrics transform processor can be used to rename metrics, and add, rename
or delete label keys and values. It can also be used to perform scaling and
aggregations on metrics across labels or label values. The complete list of
supported operations that can be applied to one or more metrics is provided in
the below table.

:information_source: This processor only supports renames/aggregations **within
a batch of metrics**. It does not do any aggregation across batches, so it is
not suitable for aggregating metrics from multiple sources (e.g. multiple nodes
or clients).

| Operation                     | Example (based on metric `system.cpu.usage`)                                                    |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rename metrics                | Rename to `system.cpu.usage_time`                                                               |
| Add labels                    | Add new label `identifier` with value `1` to all points                                         |
| Rename label keys             | Rename label `state` to `cpu_state`                                                             |
| Rename label values           | For label `state`, rename value `idle` to `-`                                                   |
| Delete data points            | Delete all points where label `state` has value `idle`                                          |
| Toggle data type              | Change from `int` data points to `double` data points                                           |

In addition to the above:

- Operations can be applied to one or more metrics using a `strict` or `regexp`
  filter
- The `action` property allows metrics to be:
  - Updated in-place (`update`)
  - Copied and updates applied to the copy (`insert`)
  - Combined into a newly inserted metric that is generated by combining all data
    points from the set of matching metrics into a single metric (`combine`); the
    original matching metrics are also removed
- When renaming metrics, capturing groups from the `regexp` filter will be
  expanded
- When adding or updating a label value, `{{version}}` will be replaced with
  this collector's version number

## Configuration

Configuration is specified through a list of transformations and operations.
Transformations and operations will be applied to all metrics in order so that
later transformations or operations may reference the result of previous
transformations or operations.

```yaml
processors:
  metricstransform:
  # transforms is a list of transformations with each element transforming a metric selected by metric name
    transforms:
    
        # SPECIFY WHICH METRIC(S) TO MATCH
        
        # include specifies the metric name used to determine which metric(s) to operate on
      - include: <metric_name>
        # match_type specifies whether the include name should be used as a strict match or regexp match, default = strict
        match_type: {strict, regexp}
    
        # experimental_match_labels specifies the label set against which the metric filter will work. If experimental_match_labels is specified, transforms will only be applied to those metrics which 
        # have the provided metric label values. This works for both strict and regexp match_type. This is an experimental feature.
        experimental_match_labels: {<label1>: <label_value1>, <label2>: <label_value2>}
        
        # SPECIFY THE ACTION TO TAKE ON THE MATCHED METRIC(S)
        
        # action specifies if the operations (specified below) are performed on metrics in place (update), or an inserted clone (insert)
        action: {update, insert}
        
        # SPECIFY HOW TO TRANSFORM THE METRIC GENERATED AS A RESULT OF APPLYING THE ABOVE ACTION
        
        # new_name specifies the updated name of the metric; if action is insert or combine, new_name is required
        new_name: <new_metric_name_inserted>
       
        # submatch_case specifies the case that should be used when adding label values based on regexp submatches when performing a combine action; leave blank to use the submatch value as is
        submatch_case: {lower, upper}
        # operations contain a list of operations that will be performed on the resulting metric(s)
        operations:
            # action defines the type of operation that will be performed, see examples below for more details
          - action: {add_label, update_label, delete_label_value, filter_datapoints}
            # label specifies the label to operate on
            label: <label>
            # new_label specifies the updated name of the label; if action is add_label, new_label is required
            new_label: <new_label>
            # aggregated_values contains a list of label values that will be aggregated; if action is aggregate_label_values, aggregated_values is required
            new_value: <new_value>
            # label_value specifies the label value for which points should be deleted; if action is delete_label_value, label_value is required
            label_value: <label_value>
            # label_set contains a list of labels that will remain after aggregation; if action is aggregate_labels, label_set is required
            label_set: [labels...]
            # value_actions contain a list of operations that will be performed on the selected label
            value_actions:
                # value specifies the value to operate on
              - value: <current_label_value>
                # new_value specifies the updated value
                new_value: <new_label_value>
```

## Examples

operations:
  ...
```

### Create a new metric from an existing metric with matching label values with regexp
```yaml

action: update
operations:
  - action: update_label
    label: state
    new_label: cpu_state
